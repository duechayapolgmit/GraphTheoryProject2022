# GraphTheoryProject2022
Repository containing a Jupyter notebook (titled `graph_isomorphism.ipynb`) of the project for Graph Theory (ATU Year 3)

The notebook contains these following topics discussed:
* What is Graph Isomorphism and the determination of Graph Isomorphism
* The Graph Isomorphism Problem and attempts of making this efficient
* Special solved cases for graph isomorphism problem
* Applications for the graph isomorphism problem
