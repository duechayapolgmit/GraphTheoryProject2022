Therefore, it is much more reliable to go through all the permutations of the graphs.\n",

One such algorithm is the **László Babai algorithm**. The strategy is to break the graph to smaller instances using canonical colouring/equipartition (colouring vertices of the same degree and same neighbours) Then, compare the colours to see if they correspond to each other. This approach helps reduce the amount of checks required to prove that the graphs are isomorphic, and therefore, reduce the runtime to be in quasipolynomial time.\n",
