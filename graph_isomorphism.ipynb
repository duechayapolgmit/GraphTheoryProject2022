    "# Graph Isomorphism Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graph Isomorphism Problem** (or GI, for short) concerns two finite graphs, whether they are isomorphic or not. A graph is **isomorphic** when the graph can have more than one form, with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the same number of edges,\n",
    "* the same number of nodes, \n",
    "* a bijection that when one node is linked to another node in another graph, that link equates to one exists in the edges of both graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, **Graph Isomorphism Problem** involves how to determine if the graphs are isomorphic or not, fulfilling conditions above. This would involve making combinations of bijections to determine the isomorphic nature of the graphs. The combinations make would increase in a factorial number, depending on the amount of nodes, (e.g. 5 nodes will have 5! possible combinations) if done in a brute force method."
